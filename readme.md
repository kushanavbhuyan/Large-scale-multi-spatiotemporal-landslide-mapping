# A general deep transfer learning model for multi-temporal landslide mapping using HR EO data

### We introduce a novel cross-modal deep transfer learning strategy for deep learning that enables the Attention Deep Supervision Multi-scale U-Net model (ADSMS-UNet) to be customized for landslide detection tasks in different environments. By using the pre-trained models, this method enables quick mapping of landslides at various spatiotemporal scales. The technique also offers the adaptability of re-training a pretrained model to identify landslides caused by both rainfall and earthquakes on different target locations. We created multi-temporal landslide inventories for subsets of four regions hit by large earthquakes: (1) the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan, China, (2) the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal, (3) the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaik≈çura, New Zealand, and (4) the 2018 Mw 7.5 Porgera, Papua New Guinea.
