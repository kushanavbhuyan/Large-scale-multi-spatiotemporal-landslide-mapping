### Contains a sample model training notebook with transfer learning module. 

Please remember that you'll need a pre-trained model to initiate the transfer learning approach. If you do not have one then, you can train a model on a preliminary region first, and then use the weights from that region to employ on another region. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
